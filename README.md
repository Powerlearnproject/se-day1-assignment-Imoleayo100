**1. The Introduction of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s)**
**Description**: Structured programming emerged as a response to the difficulties encountered in managing and understanding large, complex software systems. Before structured programming, software was often written in a monolithic, unstructured manner, making it difficult to debug, maintain, and scale.
**Key Features:** Structured programming introduced concepts like modularity, control structures (such as loops, conditionals, and subroutines), and the elimination of "goto" statements, which led to more readable, maintainable, and reliable code.
**Impact:** This milestone laid the foundation for modern programming practices, emphasizing the importance of writing clear, logical, and maintainable code. It also paved the way for the development of more sophisticated programming languages like C, which supported structured programming principles.

**2. The Development of the Waterfall Model (1970s)**
**Description:** The Waterfall Model was one of the first formalized software development methodologies, introduced by Dr. Winston W. Royce in 1970. It describes a linear and sequential approach to software development, where each phase must be completed before the next begins.
**Key Phases**: The Waterfall Model includes stages such as requirements analysis, system design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each stage produces specific deliverables and documentation.
**Impact**: The Waterfall Model became the dominant framework for software development for many years. It brought discipline to the software development process by enforcing a structured approach, which was particularly beneficial for large-scale projects. However, its rigidity also highlighted the need for more flexible methodologies, leading to the development of iterative and agile approaches later on.

**3. The Rise of Agile Methodologies (2001-Present)**
**Description:** Agile methodologies represent a major shift in software engineering, emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. The Agile Manifesto, published in 2001, articulated the values and principles that underpin agile practices, such as prioritizing individuals and interactions over processes and tools, and responding to change over following a plan.
**Key Practices:** Agile methodologies include frameworks like Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP). They focus on iterative development, where software is developed in small, incremental cycles, with regular feedback from stakeholders to ensure alignment with user needs.
**Impact:** Agile has transformed the way software is developed, especially in environments where requirements are expected to evolve. It has enabled teams to deliver working software more frequently, adapt to changing customer needs, and improve collaboration between developers and stakeholders. Agile practices have become the industry standard for many software development teams around the world.
